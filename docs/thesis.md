**Software as Accessible Leverage: Empowering Individuals to Build**

---

## The Core Insight

**Software is the most accessible form of leverage ever created.**

Throughout history, leverage has come in many forms — capital, labor, real estate, machines. Each required significant resources to acquire and deploy. Software is different. With modern AI and machine learning tools, combined with decades of open-source infrastructure, **any individual can become a software company**.

One person. A computer. An internet connection. That's the startup cost.

The barrier to entry is no longer capital or connections. **The barrier is understanding.**

---

## The Gap

If you've never been inside a software company, you might not understand:

- The nature of the process we go through
- How we think about solving problems
- What patterns we apply
- What tools are at our disposal
- **What's even possible**

This gap isn't about intelligence or capability. It's about exposure. It's about having **bits to think with**.

---

## Bits to Think With

When you understand how software works — not syntax, but *how systems are structured, how data flows, how problems decompose* — you gain a new lens for seeing the world.

**You start to notice things.**

When you look out into the world:
- You see how things work (and don't work)
- You model systems in your head
- You ask: *"How did they solve that?"*
- You wonder: *"Why is this thing broken?"*

This isn't just about building software. It's about building **mental models** that transfer everywhere.

## Protocols Are Everywhere

Much of what I've done in my career is **protocol engineering** — thinking about:

- How actors are defined
- What their boundaries are
- What their interests and incentives are
- How they interact with one another

The point of protocol engineering is to develop an understanding of what your system needs to accomplish its goals, given the actors and constraints.

**Here's the insight**: When you look at the world through this lens, you see protocols everywhere.

Standing in line at the DMV? That's a protocol.
Filing expenses at work? Protocol.
Ordering coffee? Protocol.
Voting? Protocol.
Healthcare? Protocol.

**And all the things that feel wrong — the frustrations, the inefficiencies, the "why does it have to be this way" moments — those are broken protocols.**

Often the problem is that protocols are **implicit** rather than **explicit**. Nobody wrote them down. Nobody designed them. They just... happened. And nobody knows who has the authority to change them.

Making protocols explicit is the first step to making them better.

## Your Uniqueness Is a Superpower

Every person notices different things.

Your background, your experiences, your frustrations, your joys — these shape what catches your attention. What seems obvious to you might be invisible to someone else.

**Every time you notice friction — in your own life, or when someone tells you about theirs — that's opportunity knocking.**

Not every opportunity is a billion-dollar business. Not every friction is worth solving. But if you develop the habit of:

1. Noticing friction
2. Understanding the underlying protocol
3. Imagining how software could help
4. Testing small solutions

...then eventually you'll land on something. And then another thing. And you'll get better at distinguishing between "interesting idea" and "real value."

## What Actually Matters

Building something that makes money is nice. But money isn't the point.

**Building something that provides value to real people — and being able to see that value, and get feedback from those people — that's what drives this work.**

The feedback loop of:
1. Notice a problem
2. Build a solution
3. Give it to people
4. See it help them
5. Learn from their feedback
6. Make it better

This is the most rewarding work there is. And it's now accessible to anyone willing to learn.

## The DevFoundry Mission

DevFoundry exists to **close the understanding gap**.

We believe there's a minimum amount of software knowledge — not syntax, but *how software works* — that people need to effectively use the current and future generations of AI tools.

With that foundation, you can:
- Build your own products from scratch
- Solve problems you uniquely notice
- Create value for people you uniquely understand
- Participate in the leverage that software provides

This isn't about becoming a "professional developer" (though that's an option). It's about becoming **software-literate** in an age where software literacy is power.

---

## Learning Together

This isn't a solo journey.

Software has always been built by communities — open source, shared knowledge, standing on the shoulders of giants. DevFoundry embraces this.

We're:
- **Collecting problems** that people want solved
- **Building in the open** so others can learn from the process
- **Creating curriculum** that's accessible and practical
- **Fostering community** where people discover this process together

---

## The Invitation

If any of this resonates with you:

- If you've noticed friction and wondered "why can't this be better?"
- If you've wanted to build something but didn't know where to start
- If you've been curious about how software actually works
- If you want to turn your unique perspective into something real

**You're in the right place.**

Let's discover this process together.

## Summary: The DevFoundry Thesis

1. **Software is accessible leverage** — Anyone can build software products now
2. **The barrier is understanding** — Not capital, not credentials, just knowledge
3. **Mental models transfer** — Learning to think in systems helps everywhere
4. **Protocols are everywhere** — And most broken things are broken protocols
5. **Your uniqueness matters** — You notice what others miss
6. **Friction is opportunity** — Every frustration is a potential solution
7. **Value beats money** — Building for real people is the reward
8. **Community accelerates learning** — We're building this together
