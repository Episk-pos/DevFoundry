# Agent Prompt: Add Question-Asking Coaching to Minimal User Loop Exercise

Background
The minimal user loop exercise is conceptual. Learners need explicit help
forming good questions and using AI safely without outsourcing thinking.
Add a short coaching block early in the exercise.

Project Context
DevFoundry is a learning-oriented documentation repo for people new to
software development, often Windows-first and CLI-anxious. Canonical docs
live in `website/docs/` and are deployed with Docusaurus. The overall
docs reorg aims to improve navigation, progression, and question-asking
coaching without introducing new features.

Purpose
You are a coding agent. Add a short coaching block exactly as described.

Scope
- `website/docs/exercises/minimal-user-loop.md`

What to change
1) Add a short "Ask Better Questions" block early in the exercise.
2) Include 2-3 example questions focused on loop clarity and friction.
3) Provide a short AI prompt template that is safe and specific.

Constraints
- Keep tone supportive and low-anxiety.
- Minimal formatting; avoid long blocks.

Acceptance Criteria
- Block is added near the top of the exercise.
- Includes 2-3 example questions and one prompt template.

Deliverable
- Provide the exact inserted block and placement location.
