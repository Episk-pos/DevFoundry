# Projects

**Active work being built by the community**

---

## What Is This?

This directory contains projects that community members are actively building. Each project:

- Addresses a real problem (often from [Problems](/docs/community/problems))
- Is being built in public
- Documents the journey, not just the result
- Welcomes learning and collaboration

## Why Build in Public?

**Transparency accelerates learning.**

When you build in public:
- You stay accountable
- Others can learn from your process
- You get feedback earlier
- You attract collaborators
- You demonstrate rather than just talk

## How to Use This

### Starting a project?

1. Use the project template (see community templates)
2. Create a new file: `projects/your-project-name.md`
3. Link to the problem you're solving
4. Update it as you make progress

You can start before you have code. The journey starts with validation.

### Want to contribute to a project?

1. Browse active projects
2. Read their "How to Contribute" section
3. Reach out to the maintainer
4. Start small

### Just curious?

Read the build logs. Learn from others' journeys. See what's working and what's not.
