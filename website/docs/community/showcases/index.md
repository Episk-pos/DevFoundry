# Showcases

**Completed projects and success stories**

---

## What Is This?

This directory contains stories of completed projects — what was built, what problem it solved, and what was learned along the way.

These aren't just portfolio pieces. They're **case studies** that help others learn:
- What the journey actually looked like
- What worked and what didn't
- What you'd do differently
- How you validated and iterated

## Why Showcase?

**Stories teach more than tutorials.**

When you share your journey:
- Others see what's actually possible
- They learn from your mistakes (so they don't repeat them)
- They get inspired to start their own projects
- The community builds collective knowledge

## How to Add a Showcase

1. Your project should be complete enough to use (doesn't have to be perfect)
2. Write up the story using the format below
3. Create a file: `showcases/your-project-name.md`
4. Submit a PR

### Showcase Format

```markdown
# [Project Name]

> One-line description

## The Problem

What friction did you notice? Who experiences it?

## The Solution

What did you build? How does it work?

## The Journey

How did it actually go? Include:
- How you validated the problem
- Key decisions and pivots
- Things that worked
- Things that didn't
- Timeline (rough)

## What I Learned

Key insights from the experience.

## The Numbers (Optional)

Any metrics worth sharing: users, usage, feedback.

## Try It

Link to the project, demo, or code.

## About the Builder
