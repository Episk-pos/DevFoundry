# Problems

**A collection of friction waiting to be solved**

---

## What Is This?

This directory contains documented problems — friction that community members have noticed and want to see solved.

Each problem file describes:
- What the friction is
- Who experiences it
- How people cope today
- Why existing solutions fall short
- Potential directions for solutions

## Why Document Problems?

**Problems are opportunities.**

By documenting friction:
- We create a shared awareness of what needs solving
- We help match problems with people who want to build
- We enable learning by working on real issues
- We avoid duplication of effort

## How to Use This

### Looking for something to build?

1. Browse the problems here
2. Find one that resonates with your experience
3. Reach out to express interest
4. Start validating and building (see [Friction to Opportunity](/mental-models/friction-to-opportunity))

### Want to contribute a problem?

1. Use the problem template (see community templates)
2. Create a new file: `problems/your-problem-name.md`
3. Fill in the template with what you know
4. Submit a PR or issue

You don't need all the answers. Partial documentation is valuable.
