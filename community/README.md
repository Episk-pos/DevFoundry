# DevFoundry Community

**Building Software Together: Problems, Projects, and People**

---

## Why Community?

Software has always been built by communities. Open source, shared knowledge, standing on the shoulders of giants. DevFoundry embraces this tradition.

We believe:
- **Learning is social** — You go faster with others
- **Problems are shared** — Your friction is someone else's friction
- **Perspectives multiply** — Different people notice different things
- **Building in public** — Transparency accelerates learning

This directory is where community collaboration happens.

## What's Here

### [/problems](problems/)
A collection of real problems that people want solved. These come from:
- Community members sharing their friction
- Discussions and conversations
- Common themes across different contexts

Each problem is documented with:
- What the friction is
- Who experiences it
- How people cope currently
- Why existing solutions fall short
- Ideas for potential solutions

**Problems are opportunities.** Anyone can pick one up and work on it.

### [/projects](projects/)
Active projects being built by community members. This includes:
- Projects solving problems from the `/problems` directory
- Tools being built in public
- Experimental solutions and prototypes

Each project documents:
- What problem it addresses
- Current status
- How to contribute
- What's been learned

### [/showcases](showcases/)
Completed projects and success stories:
- What was built
- What problem it solved
- What the journey looked like
- Lessons learned

These serve as inspiration and case studies.

### [/resources](resources/)
Community-curated resources:
- Useful tools and services
- Learning materials
- Communities and forums
- People doing interesting work

## How to Participate

### Share a Problem

Have friction you've noticed? We want to hear about it.

1. Create a new file in `/problems` using the [problem template](templates/problem.md)
2. Describe the friction, who experiences it, and current workarounds
3. Submit a PR or issue

Not every problem becomes a project. That's fine. Documenting problems builds shared awareness.

### Work on a Problem

Want to build something?

1. Browse `/problems` for something that resonates
2. Comment on the problem to express interest
3. Start small — validate before building
4. Document your journey in `/projects`

You don't need permission. Just start.

### Share What You've Built

Completed something? Share it.

1. Add to `/showcases` with a writeup
2. Include: problem solved, approach, lessons learned
3. Link to the project/code

Your story helps others learn.

### Contribute Resources

Know something useful?

1. Add to `/resources` in the appropriate category
2. Include why it's valuable

## Community Guidelines

### Be Generous

Share problems, share solutions, share knowledge. The community grows when everyone contributes.

### Be Curious

Ask questions. Explore others' problems. Offer perspectives from your unique background.

### Be Kind

Everyone is learning. Assume good intent. Help people level up.

### Build in Public

Transparency > secrecy. Share your journey, including failures. Others learn from real experiences.

### Start Small

Don't try to solve everything. Pick one thing. Make it better. Iterate.

## Getting Started

1. **Introduce yourself** — Open an issue or discussion saying hi
2. **Browse problems** — See what friction others have noticed
3. **Share your friction** — Document something you've noticed
4. **Pick something to build** — Small is fine; start somewhere
5. **Connect with others** — Find people working on similar things

---

## The Vision

DevFoundry's community is about:

1. **Collecting real problems** — A repository of friction waiting to be solved
2. **Matching problems with builders** — People who notice + people who build
3. **Learning together** — Shared curriculum, shared process
4. **Building in public** — Transparency as pedagogy
5. **Creating value** — Things that actually help real people

We're not trying to build the next unicorn (though that'd be fine). We're trying to create a community where anyone can go from "I notice this problem" to "I built a solution" — and learn the skills of software along the way.

## Connect

- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions, ideas, and conversations
- **Issues**: For specific problems, bugs, and suggestions
- **Discord**: [Link TBD] for real-time chat

*This community is just starting. Your participation shapes what it becomes.*
