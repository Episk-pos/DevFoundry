## The Journey

Part V picks up where Part III left off. You deployed your app to managed platforms — now you'll learn the infrastructure patterns that professional teams use to ship and operate software at any scale.

```
Module 19             Module 20              Module 21
Containerization  →   Observability    →     Infrastructure
& Orchestration       & Reliability          as Code
Docker, K8s           Logs, Metrics,         Terraform, GitOps,
                      Alerting               Automated Provisioning
```

## Roadmap

### Module 20: Observability & Reliability (Planned)

Understanding what your application is doing in production:
- Structured logging and log aggregation
- Metrics collection and dashboards
- Distributed tracing
- Alerting strategies and on-call practices
- SLOs, SLIs, and error budgets

### Module 21: Infrastructure as Code (Planned)

Managing infrastructure declaratively:
- Why infrastructure should be versioned like application code
- Terraform fundamentals
- GitOps workflows
- Secrets management
- Cloud provider patterns (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Prerequisites

Complete [Part III: Building Applications](../part-3-building-applications/) before starting Part V. Part IV (Historical Context) is recommended but not required.
